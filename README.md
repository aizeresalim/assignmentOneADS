This is Assignment1 Project made by Aizere Salim from SE-2215 for Algorithms and Sata Structures course in Astana IT University.
Project consists of 10 tasks:
First task - Find min out of range of int numbers
How solved: The program defines a method called solve() which initializes an array of integers and calls the findMin() method to find the minimum value in the array. The findMin() method is a recursive method that takes an array and its length as input parameters.

Second task - The task2 class contains a static method solve() which calculates the average of a given array of integers.  How solved:The calculateAverage(int[] arr) method is used to calculate the average of the integers in the input array arr.



Third task - checks if a given number is prime or not. How solved: The program defines a method called isPrime that takes an integer n as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether n is prime or not.



Fourth task - takes an integer input from the user and calculates its factorial using recursion. How solved: The program begins by importing the Scanner class to read user input from the console. It then prompts the user to enter a number and reads it using the nextInt() method of the Scanner class.
The program then calls the findFactorial() method with the user input as an argument. This method uses recursion to calculate the factorial of the input number. If the input is 0 or 1, it simply returns 1 as the factorial of these numbers is defined as 1. Otherwise, it multiplies the input number by the factorial of n-1 until n=1 is reached.

Fifth task -  Fibonacci that takes an integer n and returns the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence. The main method solve prompts the user to input a value for n and calls the Fibonacci method to compute the result, which is then printed to the console. The Fibonacci method is implemented using recursion. If n is 0 or 1, the method returns the corresponding value. Otherwise, it recursively calls itself with n-1 and n-2 as input values and adds the results.
